# rpi-photobox

A Photobox/Photobooth software for the RaspberryPi written in Java.

## Requirements

- Raspberry PI 4 (Works with RPi3 also, but the USB image transfer between camera and RPi4 is about 4 times faster.)

- Liberica Java Development Kit Version 11 from [BellSoft](https://bell-sw.com/java11). The version for Linux ARMv7 contains Device IO API as additional module and JavaFX with hardware-accelerated EGL support for the Raspberry Pi.
